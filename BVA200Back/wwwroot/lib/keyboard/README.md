A pop-up keyboard plugin for jQuery

This code was written mid-2009, but I thought I'd get it on GitHub in 2018 for sentimental value.

I had to update the jQuery CDN, remove some `toggle` calls, but then it worked as nicely as it did almost 10 years ago.

The plugin was created for a web application whose users would only have access to a mouse.
